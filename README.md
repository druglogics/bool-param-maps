Data analyses and investigations related to *boolean model parameterization* and how we can put millions of different parameterized models on the same map!

For more details see the [report](https://druglogics.github.io/bool-param-maps/).
Note that most of the data from the simulations with UMAP are in the Zenodo archive to save space.
